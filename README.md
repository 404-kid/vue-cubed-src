# Vue-Cubed

### Synopsis

This plug-in is intended to streamline 3D Vue.js projects by creating and manipulating one renderer increasing speeds. It also has a full module system for Three.js which it uses to render scenes.

## Install to your Vue project
```
npm i vue-cubed
```

### Initiate at the start of your project
(in main.js)
```
import VueCubed from 'vue-cubed'


Vue.use(VueCubed)
```

### How to use


Vue-cubed uses a custom component called "VueScene" it can be added to any template like so.
```
<VueScene/>
```
This creates an empty canvas element within the rendered scene and assigns it to the component its in, inheriting any style property.

Vue-cubed creates global variables, this is done to prevent multiple renderers being created and destroyed which frees up memory.
```
this.$THREE (gives you acsess to the Three.js modules use it like you would use THREE in normal Three.js applications)
this.$scene (the global scene that will be switched between components)
this.$camera (the global camera)
this.$renderer (the global renderer, MAKE SURE TO CALL this.$renderer.render(this.$scene, this.$camera) INSIDE THE PARENT COMPONENT)
```
From here on in you can create objects and manipulate the scene as you please.
